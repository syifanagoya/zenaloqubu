I had been looking forward to seeing them all weekend. He was the only student in the whole class. Unquestionably a benefit to each and every one of the people that he was able to get to know. Almost immediately after we started going to Grace Chapel, we were put in contact with him. He had been receiving therapy for brain cancer for a significant length of time at this point.</p><p>When I talked to him, regardless of what he was going through, he was always in a happy attitude, and he was constantly thanking God for whatever he had. What a humble person he was, always giving credit to and giving praise to others right up till the very end of his life.</p><p>Our boys had a huge amount of admiration and regard for him, and they enjoyed spending time in his company. The year prior, when we were both attending the same summer camp, we became good friends. I pleaded with the Lord to instruct me on how to become a prayer warrior for him, and the Lord granted my request. When God told me that I would feel horrible about myself if I didn’t pay him a visit on Sunday, I was extremely pleased that I listened to him and obeyed him. I feel much better about myself now.</p><p>Observing him engage in conversation with my good friend Bjorn was taxing, but in the end it was incredibly fulfilling. Danny Allen, you will remain in our thoughts and hearts forever, and we will never stop remembering the good times we had together. I would want to use this opportunity to convey my appreciation to you for loving my children and for contributing to the overall improvement of the planet. Would you kindly reserve me a seat? I am grateful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsMCnpbJlkaG5prqMqJmirKWWv7p5y56Yq6ZdoryzsYyamaitpGKxorrNsmSapJyau26wxJqroWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-schwahn.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Schwahn News - Us Weekly</span></a>
