But Sarah, who is currently studying a course called Children, Advertising, and Consumer Culture received an assignment with a group. There she and her classmates would reflect on the topic of Sex, Children, and Advertising.</p><p>LeMoine said:</p><p>“As I started to broadly research the sexualization of children’s cartoons, a common TV show that came up was&nbsp;SpongeBob. There were many articles about the innuendos and subliminal sexualization in the show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sarah-LeMoine.jpg><p>”I thought that this was a strong show to use because many of us grew up watching it but wouldn’t realize the sexualization of it until you go back and watch it,”</p><p>Sarah then decided to share some of her findings on TikTok where she shared her interesting takes on the cartoon and its characters.</p><p>Her video received over seven million views and people expressed their views on her findings.</p><p>Starting her statement, Sarah said:</p><p>”They live in Bikini Bottom. A group of men live in a girl’s bikini bottoms with Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs- like the STD- Krusty Krab, Krabby Patty…’</p><p>Also, Read&nbsp;<a href=#>Pop icon Kris Wu is sentenced to 13 years in prison for sexual offenses including rape</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Disney_was_also_accused_of_sexualizing_its_cartoon_characters></span>Disney was also accused of sexualizing its cartoon characters<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sarah pointed out that it is spelled Capital ‘C’, lowercase ‘h’, capital ‘U’, and capital ‘M’- insinuating that it tries to tell the word CUM.</p><p>Furthermore, LeMoine also discussed an episode where the characters, Spongebob and Sandy do Karate. In the episode, SpongeBob forces Sandy to do Karate late at night. Sarah says it represents sex.</p><p>Sandy then tells him to do it alone which represents masturbation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sarah-LeMoine-1.jpg><p>After enough research, Sarah and her team now believe that the writers of the show intentionally used such sexual messages in the cartoon.</p><p>She said:</p><p>”Notably, these are also children’s TV shows, and often parents are watching with their children. By including jokes and references that are understood by the parents but fly over the head over their children the parebts is also targeted and entertained.”</p><p>Sexualizing children’s cartoons is not something new. Many people have been saying Disney movies have expressed sexual references for years.</p><p>Also, Read&nbsp;<a href=#>Three Dozen Women Filed a Joint Lawsuit Against Serial Sexual Predator, James Toback for Sexual Misconduct!</a></p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
