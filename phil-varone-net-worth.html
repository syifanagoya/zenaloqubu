Varone confessed that he had been suffering from sex addiction; he later discussed his personal battles on the "Today Show", "The <a href=# title="Tyra Banks Net Worth">Tyra Banks</a> Show", and "<a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah</a>". His memoir, "Un-Philtered: Real Life On and Off the Rock 'n Roll Tour Bus", published in early 2013.
