I got my first two professional acting jobs from open-call auditions in New York City: the Broadway revival of Hair and the Broadway company of Grease.</p><p>2. I was playing Danny Zuko [in Grease on Broadway] when the movie came out.</p><p>3. I’ve done 10 Broadway shows — five musicals and five plays.</p><p>4. The moment I realized I’d made it was after the packed premiere of my first movie, The Idolmaker, at Radio City Music Hall. A mob of girls grabbed my tie and nearly strangled me. I thought, “This is different … and kind of scary.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Peter-Gallagher-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-Inline.jpg><p>5. I’m really shy.</p><p>6. My first car was a 1968 Cougar XR7 convertible, which I bought very used. It had a lot of electrical problems.</p><p>7. I have an economics degree from Tufts University.</p><p>8. One thing I learned from [my major] was that I wasn’t very interested in business.</p><p>9. Over the years, people have insisted I was <strong>Robby Benson</strong> or <a href=#><strong>Harry Hamlin</strong></a>. Recently, a small but vocal group was convinced I’m <a href=#><strong>Billy Bob Thornton</strong></a>. I’m in good company!</p><p>10. I can do pretty good impressions of some people who are long since departed. Unfortunately, fewer and fewer people can tell if the impressions are any good.</p><p>11. I can speak gibberish in any number of languages. It’s been very helpful on several occasions.</p><p>12. The best advice I’ve received is that 90 percent of life is showing up.</p><p>13. I have an Irish and a United States passport.</p><p>14. I have an extraordinary offscreen wife, <strong>Paula</strong>, and have had some pretty great onscreen wives, including <a href=#><strong>Jane Fonda</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Mary Steenburgen</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong></a>.</p><p>15. I broke my eardrum diving off a 60-foot cliff when I was 16. It healed.</p><p>16. I won $500,000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire for the Alzheimer’s Association.</p><p>17. Years ago, as I was leaving Dublin’s Clarence Hotel, which is owned by U2, <a href=#><strong>Bono</strong></a> held the door for me. I really tried to say something — anything! — but I was dumbstruck, so I gave a feeble nod and kept going.</p><p>18. Jack Lemmon gave me my first set of golf clubs, and I’ve been hooked ever since.</p><p>19. I’ve made three hole in ones.</p><p>20. I met my wife [in our] freshman year of college. We’ve been married for 37 years.</p><p>21. Our son, James, and I had our appendixes out on the same date — 40 years apart.</p><p>22. Our daughter, Kathryn, made her Broadway debut in a theater I’d worked in years before. I’d brought her for Take Your Daughter to Work Day.</p><p>23. The only time I ever played hockey on an ice rink and wore the full equipment was at Madison Square Garden, with former N.Y. Rangers [in front of] 13,000 people. I didn’t have a heart attack.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I love tools and building stuff.</p><p>25.
