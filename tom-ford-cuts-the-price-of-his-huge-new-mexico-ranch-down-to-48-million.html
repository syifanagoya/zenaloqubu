And contrary to what you might assume from Ford's apparent wish to sell the property quickly at its new lower price, he recently spoke exceedingly fondly of the ranch to Forbes magazine:</p><p><strong>"I am happier at my ranch in the middle of nowhere, watching a bug carry leaves across the grass, listening to silence, riding my horses and being in open space."</strong></p><p>Be that as it may, he's apparently ready to move on, and as a result some lucky buyer out there can get the impressive property for a relative steal.</p><p>Once upon a time known as Cook Ranch, Ford renamed the property Cerro Pelon Ranch when he bought it in 2001. And its most impressive feature may not be the previously mentioned house but Silverado, a complete Hollywood-style movie backlot western town originally constructed for the 1984 film Silverado, it's since been used for productions like Cowboys and Aliens, 3:10 to Yuma, and even 2011's Thor.</p><p>You can take a look at Tom Ford's newly discounted Cero Pelon Ranch in the video below, courtesy of the property's official listing from the Kevin Boblosky Group:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGekpLpuss6rm2abpanAbsDHnmSpqpmYsm67xWafoqtdncKosYynnLBlnZrFqq%2FOZqmappOdeqW71qdkraddaYVuucilo6KnnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-lachey-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Nick Lachey Net Worth 2024: From Music Fame to Real Estate Success</span></a>
