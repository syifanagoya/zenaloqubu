He has mild cerebral palsy, and actively sought out roles that allowed him to educate about cerebral palsy. He was then cast in the role of Walter White, Jr. on the multi-award-winning series, "Breaking Bad". He played the role from 2008 until the show's end in 2013. In addition to his work on "Breaking Bad", he has also appeared in the film, "Stump", and is slated to appear in the films, "Wildflowers" and "The House of Last Things".

His biological parents gave him up for adoption and a few weeks after his birth, he was adopted by Roy Frank Mitte Jr. and Dyna Mitte.</p><p>At the age of three, Mitt was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. He had to wear casts on his legs for six months in order to attempt to straighten his feet. Throughout most of his childhood, Mitte wore leg braces or had to use crutches to move around. However, as he got older, he became stronger through his efforts in sports and exercise. By the time he was a teenager, he no longer needed any walking aid devices.</p><p>Mitte's parents separated and Mitte was primarily raised by his mother. By the age of 13, he was responsible for financially supporting the family, which included his younger sister. Both him and his sister were interested in pursuing acting.
