That's Bobby Bonilla Day! </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Way back in 1999</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, the New York Mets made perhaps the silliest deal ever with Bonilla, who was an actual MLB player back then, and not a retired guy in his mid-50s. The deal took the $5.9 million the Mets owed him and turned it into $29.8 million paid out over 25 annual installments from 2011 to 2035.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>You don't have to be a math whiz to realize what a ridiculous deal that is. The Mets will end up paying nearly five times what they originally owed Bonilla, simply because they didn't want to pay all of their debt at once. Also, at the time the Mets' owner was investing his money with <a href=# title="Bernie Madoff Net Worth">Bernie Madoff</a> and assumed he'd get a significantly better return saving the $5.9 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For an organization that brings in millions of dollars per year, it was a somewhat baffling decision. Especially in retrospect.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's hard to imagine what life will be like in 2031 when Harper will be getting his final paycheck from the Phillies. But we do know one thing for sure: Bonilla will still be four years away from receiving his final $1.2 million paycheck from the Mets.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kudos to Harper and his agent <a href=# title="Scott Boras Net Worth">Scott Boras</a> for negotiating a terrific deal that keeps Harper financially sound for years to come. It's not quite on the level of what Bonilla managed to pull off, but then again…what is?</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpupspuVYrWivs%2BeqWavmaG5bq7EZpyaqp6eu6h5zKilnrFdm7yzecBmo6iml2LBqrnEZpmurF2jvLV5zZ6Yq6SpYq60ecuopaBlkah6o7vBm7Bmmp%2Bjtq24wGauoqScZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./so-cringe-fans-address-their-concerns-with-dennis-williams-style-of-parenting-on-the-parent-test-549998-html.html><span>←</span><span>So cringe!!: Fans address their concerns with Dennis Williams style of parenting on The Par</span></a>
