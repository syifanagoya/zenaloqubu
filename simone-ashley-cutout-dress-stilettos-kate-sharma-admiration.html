For the appearance, she wore a striking white, tea-length dress with two ab-baring cutouts. The spaghetti-strap garment had an elegant, twisted midsection that flowed into an A-line skirt. She kept her accessories to a minimum only opting for drop earrings and lace-up strappy stilettos. Her hair was worn curly with a deep side part, and she swiped on sparkly purple eyeshadow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During the interview, Ashley explained what she found most admirable about her character. "I like the fact that she [Kate] wasn't a people pleaser, and she wasn't afraid to be opinionated and controversial, break the rules a little bit," she told the hosts. "I mean she was there to protect her sister and I wanted to stay true to that throughout the whole story," she added. "So, yeah, I really liked that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simone also opened up about her cast mate Austin, who played the family's beloved Corgi — and arguably stole the show. She explained that the pup wasn't actually a trained set dog and they had to feed him sausages to entice him to film. "I don't think he was a set dog, like an acting dog," she said. "I think he fit the aesthetic for the role, and we had to keep feeding him sausages. He would eat anything, this dog."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9KipKimlWKutLTLnrBmm6WpvLbAjJ2pnqujYsC1tcueq62no2K4osDEZqqhmaKirm6tw6agq5mknryv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-nicole-smith.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Nicole Smith News - Us Weekly</span></a>
