I like Trump because Trump is not a politician; he talks like a guy,” the <i>Happy Days </i>alum said on Sunday, October 9. “And ladies out there, this is what guys talk about when you’re not around. So if you’re offended by it, grow up. And by the way, this is what you guys talk about over white wine when you have your brunches, so take it easy with your phony outrage. This is the way the world works. It’s not a big thing.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>Predictably, Baio has been receiving backlash via Twitter over the matter. “@ScottBaio, listen you sack of sh-t, yes men like you and @realDonaldtrump talk like that because you are puny little halfwits and rapists,” one commenter wrote on Monday. Baio replied: “Actions can be taken against you if you keep accusing me of being a ‘rapist.’ Thread lightly!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-bcfc8df1-d037-479e-845a-24b693dffa6d.jpg><p>Baio, who has been open about his conservative views, <a href=#>previously spoke in support of the media mogul</a> at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, in July.</p><p>That same month, Baio made headlines for seemingly calling Democratic presidential candidate <a href=#><b>Hillary Clinton</b></a> the “c-word” on Twitter. The <i>Today</i> show’s <a href=#><b>Tamron Hall</b> called him out on live TV</a> in a cringe-worthy interview.</p><p>“Did you think about that in church when you tweeted it out?” Hall asked, referring to a photo, which showed the word behind a photo of the former secretary of state.</p><p>“I offered it without commentary,” Baio replied. “That was just put up. I just put it up there.”</p><p>Hall sniped: “Yeah, but you knew what it meant when you tweeted it out. You’re writing your speech in church, you talk about religion coming back to this country and us having a moral barometer. Where was your moral compass when you put up a photo of a woman that you disagree with politically?”</p><p>Watch Baio speak about Trump’s latest remarks in the video above.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5%2BpwW6uwKKmZpyVm7KvsNJmm6imkaGxbsDRrqSpq12hsriwjJympqWVo8G0ec2oq2aZXZe2qHnToaCnn12sgXWAkHJsaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-chanoine-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>What is Jay Chanoine Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a>
