Someone needs to explain to him something called CGI. You’re 60. Calm down. But every time <a href=#>he does one of these new stunts</a>, it does feel like an ad for Scientology. I mean, is that in Dianetics? Because there’s nothing about jumping off a cliff in the Torah.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Glen-Powell-Reveals-the-Advice-Tom-Cruise-Gave-Him-While-Filming-Top-Gun-Maverick-2.jpg><p class=p1>Cruise, who has not publicly addressed Apatow’s DGA Awards remarks, first <a href=#>joined the Church of Scientology in 1987</a> amid his marriage to first ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Mimi Rogers</strong></a>. (After the couple’s split, he was briefly married to <a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> before moving on with Holmes, 44.)</p><p class=p1>“It’s something that has helped me incredibly in my life. I’ve been a Scientologist for over 30 years,” Cruise <a href=#>previously gushed about the religion</a> during an October 2015 interview with ITV News. “It’s something, you know, <a href=#>without it, I wouldn’t be where I am</a>. So it’s a beautiful religion. I’m incredibly proud.”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Jerry Maguire&nbsp;</i>star has remained steadfast in his beliefs, <a href=#>his involvement with the controversial religion</a> has made waves through the years.</p><p class=p1>“I think it’s time for people to start waking up to the real facts here. Tom has for years manipulated his image to be the good guy,” <a href=#><strong>Leah Remini</strong></a>, who<a href=#> famously left the Church in 2013</a>, <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in a July 2020 statement</a>. “Although I believe there was a time when Tom was a decent and kindhearted person, he has morphed himself into&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>David Miscavige</strong>&nbsp;</a>[the leader of Scientology] and is completely dedicated to Scientology’s mission to ‘clear’ planet Earth — which means making 80 percent of the world’s population into Scientologists.”</p><p class=p1>Apatow’s Saturday remarks about the controversial group are not the first time that Cruise’s religion <a href=#>has been the fodder for an awards show joke</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Backstage I found these three Golden Globe awards that Tom Cruise returned,” <a href=#><strong>Jerrod Carmichael</strong></a> said <a href=#>at the Globes last month</a>, referring to the trophies that<a href=#> the&nbsp;<i>Top Gun&nbsp;</i>star</a> gave back to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in 2021 amid controversy about lack of diversity. “I have a pitch. I think, maybe, we take these three [trophies] and exchange them for the safe return of&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Shelly Miscavige</strong></a>.”</p><p class=p1>Remini, 52, previously claimed that Shelly — who is the wife of <a href=#>Scientology leader David</a> — has been presumed missing, leading <a href=#>her to file a missing person report in 2013</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“The Los Angeles Police Department has already stated that the case is closed and that the report filed by Leah Remini was unfounded,” Scientology’s Media Relations team told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in a statement at the time. “Creating this unnecessary burden for law enforcement was even more irresponsible given the entire episode was nothing more than a publicity stunt for Ms. Remini, cooked up with unemployed, anti-religious zealots who blog on the fringe of the Internet. Sadly, rather than move on with her life and career, Ms. Remini has aligned herself with a handful of untrustworthy, lunatic tabloid sources who obsessively harass the Church to advance their selfish agendas.”</p><p class=p1>Cruise’s&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Maverick&nbsp;</i>filmmaker</a>, <strong>Joseph Kosinski</strong>, was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Theatrical Feature Film at Saturday’s ceremony, but he ultimately lost to&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Everything Everywhere All at Once</i>’s<strong> Daniel Kwan</strong> and </a><strong><a href=#>Daniel Scheinert</a><i>.</i></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJugmV2WxKK%2Bw6xka2hiaHqrwcOdZJqokam8uHnSoZidnaNiwbC5jJyprqGjmnq0r8iepa2nnKS0uns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ball-large-constricting-snake-native-to-west-and-central-africa-and-which-sleeps-for-up-to-18-hours-each-day-html.html><span>←</span><span>*Ball ___ large constricting snake native to West and Central Africa... and which sleeps for up to 1</span></a>
