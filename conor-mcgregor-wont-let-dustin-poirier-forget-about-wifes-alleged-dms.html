After his loss to Poirier at UFC 264, McGregor reignited the rift when he commented on a video of Poirier discussing his involvement in a street fight. “I was at my brother’s house and there was a street party… and my wife was leaning over a fence talking to somebody. Guys from next door came over and bent over her back, while she was bending over and put his hand on her stomach, started talking in her ear,” Poirier explained, adding that he “ripped him off” and “people were fighting everywhere” after that."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
