This year’s ceremony will be held at One Embankment, London on November 10.</p><p>The Vanguard Award recognises “the impact of outstanding ASCAP members on musical genres that will help shape the future of music.”&nbsp;Previous recipients include Walk The Moon, St. Vincent, fun., Kendrick Lamar, Diplo, Calvin Harris and Janelle Monae.</p><p>Of the award, Jess&nbsp;said: “The Vanguard award marks the end of a special couple of years for me. To be recognized not only by the public but by your peers, by other songwriters, for the music you are making is so heartwarming. When I look at the names that have won these awards on both sides of the Atlantic, I can’t even believe that I have been put in such a category.”</p><p>MNEK added: “I am so grateful to have won this award. My first love and passion is music and writing songs, so to be recognized in this extraordinary way by my peers, friends and colleagues is simply incredible. I am honored and humbled by this wonderful accolade – It’s a really dope feeling!”</p><p>Jess Glynne burst onto the music scene in 2014 as a vocalist on Clean Bandit’s&nbsp;Grammy Award winning ‘Rather Be’. Since then, her career&nbsp;has gone from strength to strength, as she became&nbsp;the second British female solo artist to achieve five number one singles. Her debut album, I Cry When I Laugh, also went to number one, selling 1.7 million copies worldwide.</p><p>MNEK is a singer, songwriter and producer whose credits include Beyoncé,&nbsp;Zara Larsson, and&nbsp;Little Mix. His single, ‘Never Forget You’ featuring Zara Larsson, went platinum in the UK.</p><p>ASCAP president Paul Williams said: “We are thrilled to honor both Jess Glynne and MNEK with the ASCAP Vanguard Award. Both artists are extremely unique British talents.”</p><p>He added: “Jess has reached a multigenerational demographic with her soulful pop music and inspired songwriting. MNEK’s outstanding songs for superstars such as Beyoncé, Madonna and Kylie Minogue have made him an unmistakable force in music.”</p><p>In addition to the Vanguard Award, it was previously announced that Duran Duran will receive the ASCAP Golden Note Award. Other awards to be handed out include&nbsp;the ASCAP Global Impact, Song of the Year, Top Digital Song, Top EDM Song and Film Score of the Year honours.</p><h4>Congratulations to Jess Glynne and MNEK on their ASCAP success!
