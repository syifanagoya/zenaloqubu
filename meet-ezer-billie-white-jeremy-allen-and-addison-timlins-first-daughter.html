Her parents met in 2008 as teenagers, and even when they co-starred in a movie, they didn’t start dating immediately.</p><p>At the time Ezer was born, her parents were not yet married. However, they decided to tie the knot almost a year after her birth. Ezer Billie White has a younger sister known as Dolores Wild White. She was born in 2010.</p><p>Addison shared an<a href=#> Instagram post</a> in June 2018 to announce her pregnancy. “We made a baby, and my heart is bursting at the seams. Today is my birthday, but my wish already came true. This is 27, and the best is yet to come.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ezers_Timeline_of_Birthdays></span>Ezer’s Timeline of Birthdays<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On Ezer’s first birthday, Jeremy captured <a href=#>an adorable moment </a>and shared it on Instagram with the caption, “My heart is now one year old.” When Ezer turned two, Timlin unveiled her unique outlook on life, considering it a testament to an old soul.</p><p>In her Instagram post, Timlin wrote, “To my 1000-year-old girl, today you turn 2. It’s clear to me that you have lived many lives. The fact that you spend most of your days pretending to be a cat despite having never met one just confirms it. Thanks for spending this life with us. I love you the whole world.”</p><p>A year later, on Ezer’s third birthday, Timlin marveled at her child’s wisdom that surpassed her years. <a href=#>Timlin shared on Instagram</a>, “Ezer Billie, my baby!! Today you turn 3, but when you hold my face and ask me about my dreams, I know you are at least 100.” Accompanying the heartfelt message was an adorable picture of Ezer grinning.</p><p>Timlin continued, “I love hearing about your plans, watching ‘netfreaks’ with you, hearing you say stuff like ‘Wow, that’s so amazing’ and heavy sighs into ‘it’s so nice to be all together. My little one who appreciates the little things, you are my dream come true. I love you the most.”</p><p>The actress acknowledged Ezer’s remarkable qualities as a big sister in her Instagram post announcing the birth of her second child, stating, “Thank you, Ezer, for your patience and wisdom — you’re the most incredible big sister anyone could ask for.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-2_12_11_31.jpg><p>There isn’t much information about Ezer, who is only four years old. She is expected to continue living under her parents’ protective guidance.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_About_Ezers_Parents></span>What About Ezer’s Parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Celebrity kids</a> have one thing in common; they have parents who are rich and famous. Both appear to be true in Ezer’s case. Her parents, Jeremy Allen White and Addison Timlin White are wealthy because of their Hollywood careers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fotor_2023-6-2_12_14_59.jpg><p>Also, having married in 2019, they appear to be on the brink of divorce. According<a href=#> to People</a>, Jeremy Allen White and Addison Timlin have ended their relationship. Timlin initiated the divorce proceedings in May 2023.</p><p>Timlin and White tied the knot in October 2019 after getting engaged in April of the same year. They have since welcomed their two daughters into their family. During the Golden Globes in January 2023, Jeremy expressed his appreciation for his wife while accepting the award for best musical or comedy actor.</p><p>He said, “I love you deep in my bones; thank you for all that you do, thank you for everything that you’ve done,” he affectionately stated. Neither Timlin nor White has shared further details regarding their divorce, leaving rumors to spread.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02acs52iYq%2BquMuinGavmJ7BpnnJnqmepalirq24xKdkmqaUYq6lsMispqdlpJ66rbXNrGSfoaKowW6wwK6eoayVp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shabba-ranks-net-worth-2020-2021.html><span>←</span><span>Shabba Ranks Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</span></a>
