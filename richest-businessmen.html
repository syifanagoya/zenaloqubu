Gary Dahl was born in Bottineau, North Dakota in December 1936 and passed away in March 2015. Dahl is best known for being the creator of the Pet Rock.

Dahl used the money he made from the Pet Rock to open a bar in Los Gatos, California.</p><p>He later sold Sand Breeding Kits and Red China Dirt although neither was very successful. His agency Gary Dahl Creative Services specialized in electronic advertising. He wrote and produced many radio and television commercials. In 2007 he authored the book Advertising For Dummies from the For Dummies series.
