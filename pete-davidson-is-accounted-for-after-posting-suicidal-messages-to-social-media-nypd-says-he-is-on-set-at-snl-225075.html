The stans took to Davidson’s account to call him out.</p><p>Soon after, Pete uploaded another screenshot that read: “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last. All I’ve ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so.”</p><p>Unfortunately, trolls didn’t stop there, they encouraged him to take his life. Moments later, Pete deleted his Instagram.</p><p>That’s when many celebrities showed their outpouring love and support.</p><p>Jon Cryer took to Twitter to ask if anyone knew the 25-year-old’s location because he wasn’t able to get in contact with him.</p><p>“I just tried to text and call him, his phone is not on or out of cell coverage.
