Now Michel is seeking a new trial, claiming his representation was incompetent and even used an experimental A.I. text generating program to craft his closing argument.</p><p>Michel's legal team reportedly filed a motion for a new trial and named former defense counsel David Kenner (who has also counted <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> among his famous clients), calling him "ineffective" and alleging his botched defense "severely prejudiced the defense" and led to Michel's conviction. The motion goes on:</p><p><strong>"Kenner used an experimental AI program to write his closing argument, which made frivolous arguments, conflated the schemes and failed to highlight key weaknesses in the Government's case."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-353347 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1478407610.jpg alt width=900 height=622 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-353347 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images</p><p>Incredibly, the motion also cites a public press release from EyeLevel.AI, the program Michel's attorney allegedly used to make his closing argument, touting Michel's case as "the first use of generative AI in a federal trial." The fact that he lost the case is not mentioned in the press release. Kenner himself is quoted in the press release, calling the technology a "game changer for complex litigation."</p><p>The motion also blames faulty AI for some basic errors the attorney committed during the trial, including misattributing lyrics in songs by <a href=#>Diddy</a> and Michel as a solo artist to the Fugees group.</p><p>Michel was found guilty on 10 criminal counts stemming from his associations with Malaysian businessman <a href=#>Jho Low</a> and a <a href=#>$100 million extortion scheme</a>. Low was one of the financial backers of the 2013 film "The Wolf of Wall Street," which led to "Wolf" star <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> being called to testify in Michel's trial. Back in April, when the guilty verdicts were announced, it was reported that he could face a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, with a sentencing hearing yet to be scheduled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC80ZqqZqWZmLWmuIyonWasmJp6p8HGnpysZaeWu7W%2FjJpkq52kp7aiuIyipWagmah6cnyPZqSipJyevK95xauYrpxdmK60sYysmLKrXZ22tHnArauoqp6axm7D0airnmWToby0tc2gZJqql6q6prrTZq6irJhirm61jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-delete-your-envato-account.html><span>←</span><span>How to delete your Envato account</span></a>
