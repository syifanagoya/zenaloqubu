While you can sip down a triple-shot latte the morning after a late night to perk up, it’s much harder to disguise the exhaustion that’s written all over your face – especially under your eyes. While genetics can be to blame for some of the darkness, there are also other contributing factors — including the fact that the skin under the eyes is thinner and more delicate than it is on the rest of the face (go figure, right?). Luckily, there are specific brightening eye creams that help to diminish the look of dark circles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the most effective brightening eye creams, we put in the work — researching top-rated options and reaching out to dermatologists for their expert recommendations.

Edelweiss flower is infused into the formula, which is clinically proven to help tighten aging skin around the eye. Additionally, fractionated hyaluronic acid protects the skin’s barrier, while a dynamic blend of peptides aid in healthy collagen production.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the product’s extended advantages, this cream also instantly brightens dark circles due to its blendable pigment that addresses hyperpigmentation. Its illuminating tint works well with all skin tones, giving under-eye areas an immediate pick-me-up. If you have dry skin under your eyes, we recommend priming the area with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hyaluronic acid serum</a> before putting on this eye cream just because this product is not extremely hydrating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits:</strong> Brightens, tightens, and depuffs<strong> </strong>|<strong> Active Ingredients: </strong>Edelweiss flower, Fractionated hyaluronic acid, Collagen-boosting peptides<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>0.29 fl oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-inkey-list-brighten-i-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Inkey List Brighten-i Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Inkey List Brighten-i Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OuULm4XRy1WoKIXOM4TK1XWAbrc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Inkey-List-Brighten-i-Eye-Cream-61ab85e52c914cd5ba68befaf0f746f0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Inkey List</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a hydrating eye cream that combats dark circles, The Inkey List Brighten-i Eye Cream is just the thing you need. For starters, this lightweight formula works well with all skin types including dry, aging, and oily. Plus, it performs well as a primer under makeup. (Just be sure to only layer makeup on top of this, as additional moisturizers or serums can cause this product to pill.) These benefits are just the tip of the iceberg, though, because the brightening capabilities are also extremely impressive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This very affordable formula includes an ingredient called Brightenyl — also known as diglucosyl gallic acid — which helps prevent skin discoloration while fading existing hyperpigmentation,” explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Geeta Yadav, M.D.</a>, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>FACET Dermatology</a>. . “This makes it an ideal formula for someone who has genetic discoloration rather than temporary dark circles caused by blood pooling under the eye.

It comes with a hydrating, intensive roll-on serum that restores elasticity and radiance to aging skin, as well as 10 hydrating under-eye patches that smooth fine lines. Per the instructions, you can either use this product once a week for 10 weeks or once a day for 10 days in a row — sort of like an eye care boot camp. When used in the boot camp model, you’ll notice that after the entire course the skin under your eyes will be smooth, supple, and lifted. Alternatively, if you choose to use this for 10 weeks in a row, you will still notice the same results, they just won’t be as immediate. Pro tip: If you run out of under-eye masks, continue using the serum and top it off with a thick moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Brightens, firms, hydrates, and depuffs<strong> </strong>|<strong> Active Ingredients: </strong>Ginseng root extract, Morning glory extract<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>0.17 fl oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-loreal-paris-revitalift-triple-power-anti-aging-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=550 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Eye Cream, 0.5 fl oz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kpFLAPvK8EkD5O25KOSSueP7JbY=/fit-in/1500x550/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOrealParisRevitaliftTriplePowerAnti-AgingEyeCream0.5floz-f64c090fa2f247b0a251f096a637bf10.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>walmart</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Eye Cream is an awakening eye product that incorporates the cooling powers of the metal tip applicator to instantly decrease puffiness. The formula is packed with hyaluronic acid to plump and hydrate under-eye wrinkles, as well as vitamin C, which is an anti-aging skincare stalwart <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>known for its ability to brighten skin</a>. The non-greasy, paraben-free formula also quickly absorbs into skin, creating a smooth base for makeup application.

For the best results, we suggest using it two to three times a week to start, so your skin can adequately <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>build up a tolerance to the retinol</a>. Once your skin is comfortable with it, you can use it up to five or six times a week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Brightens, tightens, and depuffs |<strong> Active Ingredients: </strong>Pro-retinol, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>0.5 fl oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-dry-skin-shani-darden-skin-care-intensive-eye-renewal-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Dry Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shani Darden Skin Care Intensive Eye Renewal Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shani Darden Skin Care Intensive Eye Renewal Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/__l-o67h2Do9D8drocjW04EdlkA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shani-darden-intensive-renewal-eye-cream-75d53660e5fb44d3ba525872021e76c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This effective eye cream – which was created by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Shani Darden</a>, one of Hollywood’s most notable estheticians – took two years to perfect. The vegan formula is infused with nine age-defying actives, including potent peptides, silk tree extract, squalene, and niacinamide. These powerhouse ingredients work together to firm, brighten, and hydrate skin at every level. The thick cream can be applied both in the morning and at night, and keeps skin moisturized under makeup.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What we especially love about this product is that it works well with all skin types. Even though the formula itself is rich, it doesn’t make the under-eye area feel greasy or oily. It’s also ideal for aging skin, since it can help to reduce the appearance of fine lines and crow's feet. We do wish it came in a different container, or a better pump as it tends to get jammed with continued use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Benefits: </strong>Brightens and firms<strong> </strong>|<strong> Active Ingredients: </strong>Silk tree extract, Squalane, Niacinamide, Ceramides |<strong> Size: </strong>0.5 fl oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-oily-skin-perricone-md-vitamin-c-ester-ccc--ferulic-brightening-under-eye-cream></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Oily Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester CCC + Ferulic Brightening Under-Eye Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Perricone MD Vitamin C Ester CCC + Ferulic Brightening Under-Eye Cream" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sU6ZF0PCGBS7vHU4k4MbidB9uy4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Perricone-MD-Vitamin-C-Ester-CCC--Ferulic-Brightening-Under-Eye-Cream-d28cb87483a24070812aae624d5bc8be.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Perricone MD</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This formula is not a cream, but a serum, giving it a very lightweight and fast-absorbing texture that is ideal for those with oily skin,” says Dr. Yadav. “It features three forms of vitamin C and ferulic acid — all potent antioxidants — to fight and fade multiple forms of discoloration under the eye caused by hyperpigmentation.” (These forms of discoloration can include black, blue, and red under-eye circles.) Additionally, this product is made with peptides, which work to combat the appearance of puffiness and bags.

They do this in a few different ways, depending on which ingredients are used in certain products. Some brightening eye creams utilize hyaluronic acid to moisturize and plump the under-eye area. This can make dark, hollow eyes look more refreshed and awake. Ingredients like vitamin C work to stop hyperpigmentation and dark circles in their tracks by prohibiting skin from creating too much pigment. Some brightening eye creams also use light-deflecting particles (which is what <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Florence by Mills Look Alive Brightening Eye Cream</a> does) to provide instant results.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do brightening eye creams work?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Brightening eye creams work by incorporating ingredients that target dark circles, discoloration, and hyperpigmentation under the eyes. “All skincare formulas work differently depending on the ingredients used,” explains Dr. Yadav. “Many brightening eye creams contain caffeine [like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">UpCircle Eye Cream with Hyaluronic Acid and Coffee Extract</a>], an ingredient that helps fight dark circles and puffiness under the eye by facilitating blood flow. For those who’ve had a long night or have seasonal allergies, formulas with caffeine can make an instantly visible difference in the appearance of darkness around the eye.” Additionally, vitamin C can address skin discoloration, as it works to fade hyperpigmentation and prohibit skin from producing excessive melanin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Other ingredients work by building up collagen in the skin. “Peptides and retinol help to increase collagen and strengthen skin, which is a common contributor to dark circles,” says Dr. Liu. “Vitamin C, niacinamide, and illuminating ingredients can help reduce pigment and temporarily improve the appearance of dark circles.” These effective ingredients sink deep into skin to hydrate and nourish it, as well as reverse the signs of aging that wrinkles and dark circles cause.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I choose the best brightening eye cream for me?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It would be best to consult a dermatologist first to see if under-eye cream is your answer,” says Dr. Bailey. “In many cases, people spend a lot of money on eye creams and they do nothing. That money might be better spent on fixing the root of the problem if you have hollows or bags. A little hyaluronic acid (filler) injected under the eye can last a year or more and make you look rested even if you aren’t.” If you don’t want to filler, look for an eye cream that can address the main problems you are trying to solve (i.e. do you need to combat dark circles? Dry, discolored skin? Aging skin?). Or, use a brightening eye cream that targets a slew of different skin concerns like our best overall pick <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Replenix Tinted Brightening Eye Cream</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Dr. Yadav suggests trying other tactics. “Always determine what you want your eye cream to accomplish before you purchase,” she says. “I‘d also recommend considering purchasing two: One for the morning that contains brightening or color-correcting pigments that will help cosmetically blur the look of dark circles, and a second one for evening that contains an ingredient like retinol or features a more nourishing formula to help repair skin while you sleep.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lauren Harano</a> has been contributing to InStyle since August 2022, covering a wide range of beauty topics.
