The audience loves the front and the twists that come along.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With eight episodes of the show premiered, we have already witnessed some incredible moments and mesmerizing characters.

So a Prince who rides the biggest living dragon certainly drives the audience’s interest. In the eighth episode, we saw the adult version of Prince Aemond, and fans quickly became interested in the real-life actor who portrayed the character.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The actor who plays the adult Prince Aemond is Ewan Mitchell. Here are some details about the man’s personal and family life.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=quick-facts-about-ewan-mitchell></span>Quick Facts About Ewan Mitchell<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Real Name</strong></td><td>Ewan Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$500,000 (approx.)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Active</strong></td><td>2015- Present</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relationship Status</strong></td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hometown</strong></td><td>Derby</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=who-are-ewan-mitchell-parents-family-details><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-ewan-mitchell-parents-family-details></span> Who Are Ewan Mitchell Parents? Family Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ewan Mitchell’s real-life parents are unknown to outsiders as he has not disclosed any family details.</p><p>He plays Aemond, the younger son of King Viserys I and Queen Alicent Hightower, in the House of the Dragon. As the Prince of Westeros, Aemond was given a dragon egg, but the egg never hatched. So the Prince without a dragon suffered a prejudiced childhood where his brother made fun of him.</p><p>Aemond grew up with his older brother, who made fun of him, and Rhaenyra’s sons, often his rivals for the Iron Throne. His family on screen is well-defined and known to the public.</p><p>But the actor who plays the character, Mitchell, is like an unknown personality to the crowd. He is unavailable on social media and has not spoken about any facts about his parents or family. Hence, nothing regarding his mom and dad is known.</p><h2 id=ewan-mitchell-net-worth><span class=ez-toc-section id=ewan-mitchell-net-worth></span> Ewan Mitchell Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ewan Mitchell’s net worth is thought to be around $500,000.</p><p>Some online sites, such as Mashoor Media, report the actor to have a fortune worth $2 million, but there is no verified data. His primary source of income is his acting career, where he has made a credible name for himself. Although the actor is a particularly new name and face in public, Mitchell has a pretty long career in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He made his acting debut in 2015 with a short film, and his first significant role came in 2017 when he played the role of Billy Taylor in the TV series The Halcyon. Similarly, his other acting projects include The Last Kingdom, Trigger Point, and World On Fire. He portrayed the character of Osferth in The Last Kingdom for around five years before landing the part in House of the Dragon.</p><p>Hence, with an acting career of at least five years, we expect the man to have accumulated a decent wealth valued at around a couple hundred thousand. Nonetheless, the official verification regarding his fortune remains a mystery.</p><h2 id=how-old-is-ewan-mitchell><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-ewan-mitchell></span> How Old Is Ewan Mitchell?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Discussing Ewan Mitchell’s age, he is 20 years old.</p><p>He was born on March 12, 2002, in England, as reported by Mixed Article. Born and raised in the area of Derby in England, Ewan got interested in acting from a young age and pursued the same passion in his teenage years.</p><p>The young actor made his acting debut at the age of only 13 and has been actively involved in the sector since then.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=m-0><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-ewan-mitchells-age></span>What Is Ewan Mitchell’s Age?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3>Ewan Mitchell’s age is 20 years old.
