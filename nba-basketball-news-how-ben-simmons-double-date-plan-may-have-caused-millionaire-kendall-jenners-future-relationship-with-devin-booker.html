NBA stars are some of the premier and most popular athletes in the world. So obviously they are star attractions. But one story on how a double date plan made by Ben Simmons may have caused Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker to date will blow your minds.</p><p>Back in 2018, Kendall and Simmons were in a relationship. The duo had met through mutual friends and were going strong. Jenner attended Philadelphia 76ers games while Simmons played for the franchise. But then Simmons made a plan which could have caused his breakup and even planned his girlfriend’s future relationship with an All-Star.</p><p>Simmons and Jenner started dating back in 2018, but they were on and off several times. But in 2018, when they were going strong, Simmons took Jenner to dinner with his long-time friend and fellow NBA star <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Devin Booker</a> and his girlfriend.</p><p>This was in 2018 and in 2020, Simmons and Jenner officially called it quits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-03-11T003003Z_2037556610_MT1USATODAY17868076_RTRMADP_3_NBA-BROOKLYN-NETS-AT-PHILADELPHIA-76ERS.jpg><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Simmons’ double date that may have led to Devin Booker and Kendall Jenner</h2><p>And just a few weeks later, Booker and Jenner were spotted on a road trip in Arizona. The duo had remained friends since 2018 and started dating around June 2020. And now, they are <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>reportedly</a> back together after briefly splitting up last month.</p><p>And reportedly this double date is what caused them to become friends, and remained in touch since then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022-03-25T041840Z_174831558_MT1USATODAY17962530_RTRMADP_3_NBA-PHOENIX-SUNS-AT-DENVER-NUGGETS.jpg><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Ben Simmons</a>, who was with the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Philadelphia 76ers</a> at that time, has since been since traded to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Brooklyn Nets</a>. He has endured a couple of tough years as his teams have failed to make advances in the playoffs. And Simmons has been made the scapegoat. He has also endured injuries, but he hopes to be back next season at full strength.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Timeline of James Harden and Khloe Kardashian’s relationship&nbsp;</a></strong></p><p>Meanwhile, Booker has gone from strength to strength. His starting years in the NBA which included losing records, a change in coach, and the addition of Chris Paul have elevated him to an All-Star. He even made the Finals last year but ended up losing to the <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Milwaukee Bucks</a>. Booker will be keen to get back to the top next year, after enduring a shocking exit in the playoffs this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82bmGaakai4psDBmqOlZZ6axLR5x6iuZpqVo3q0tcympqerXZm8tq7LnmSdmaSaerG4wKdkppmpYrWiwsRmmpqto5qxbrnIpaOip56WtrOxjKScp5yRoblutsSnpZ6qo2KztsDUq5xmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmm56umaN6o7vOpJyrZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gheorghe-hagi-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>Gheorghe Hagi Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
