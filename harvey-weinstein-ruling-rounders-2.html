The original film, <strong>Rounders</strong>, was a fantastic movie but coming out in 1998 it was ahead of its time. Poker was nowhere near as big as it is now and the film didn’t do too well. Luckily for Miramax, the film picked up once it hit video and brought in some much needed additional revenue ($70 million to be exact).</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true><a href=#>THR</a> reports that recently, Miramax along with The Weinstein Company released a list of titles that they would be interested in developing sequels for and <strong>Rounders </strong>was on that list. <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong> recently discussed the film at the Produced By Conference and said “the video has gotten such awareness. I never make sequels but it’s something I’d like to revisit.”</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Of course, the film would have to be a theatrical success since in this day and age, studios can’t afford to have films bombing at the box office. VOD and home video sales just aren’t what they used to be. But with the now well established fan base and the names <strong>Matt Damon</strong> and <strong>Ed Norton</strong> attached to it, I don’t think it would have any trouble doing well at the box office.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>I loved <strong>Rounders</strong> and would be first in line to see a sequel. Norton and Damon have both said that they would be up for doing one and apparently the writers of the original,&nbsp;<strong>David Levien</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Brian Koppelman, </strong>have been thinking of sequel ideas for a while now. Hopefully this will all come together because the original was really a great film and it deserves a sequel.</p><p data-characters=55 data-current-count=55 data-injectable=false>Did you enjoy <strong>Rounders</strong>?
