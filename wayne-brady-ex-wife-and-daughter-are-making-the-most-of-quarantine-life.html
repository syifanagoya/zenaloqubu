Wayne Brady is currently waiting out the coronavirus pandemic with his ex-wife Mandie Taketa, their 17-year-old daughter Maile Brady, and Mandie’s current boyfriend Jason Fordham.</p><p>Many people would find self-isolating with their ex and their significant other awkward, to say the least, but it is not a problem for Wayne Brady. He and Mandie have been divorced since 2008, but they have since co-parented Maile as “best friends,” plus Brady and Jason get along very well. “I love my ex-wife, she’s my best friend, and her boyfriend Jason is my boy, and my daughter’s my daughter,” says Brady. “Some people’s new normal is my everyday Wednesday.”</p><p>Wayne Brady and Mandie now live right next door to each other and quarantine between their homes with Maile and Jason. “I’ve got a big backyard and lots of land, so we both share this land and this space,” explains Brady. Not only is Brady fine with the living arrangement, he actually finds their family dynamic funny and says it would “make a good sitcom.”</p><p>“We live next door to each other, or a few homes away from each other, and we are keeping our isolation to just our two homes. We aren’t going over to anybody else’s house, we aren’t going out to supermarkets, so we have an extended bubble of just our homes. So we are the core four. So, I think that does make a good sitcom, which I’ll write,” joked Brady.</p><p>Wayne Brady very much enjoys quarantining with his family between their homes and cherishes the quality time they spend together. “Moments like this bring you closer. We’ve been doing TikToks, we’ve been playing board games, we’ve been in my studio writing songs together and freestyling, walking the dogs up the canyon and up the streets,” says Brady. “It’s an amazing time for family, because it’s kind of like a time-out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWlmaW1fZn1ww8CypZ5lkqeupcWMnq9mr5mbsm6tzZ1knZmlnLW1sdFmmKudXaKurLXNoGStoJViurC%2F02amn2Whqq6zrc2toKedXaG2p7GO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fire-country-special-episode-1st-look-sharon-is-back-on-duty.html><span>←</span><span>'Fire Country' Special Episode 1st Look: Sharon Is Back on Duty</span></a>
