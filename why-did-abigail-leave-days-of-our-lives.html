Over the years, several actors joined <a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a> to portray Abigail's character, including Jillian Clare, who played a child version of Abigail, Ashley Benson, who played Abigail as a teenager, Kate Mansi, and most recently, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marci Miller</a>.

Rumors about Abigail getting killed off the show started swirling quite some time ago — but the plot twist left fans feeling startled just the same.</p><p>"Salem lost an angel. 'Beyond the door, there's peace, I'm sure. And I know there'll be no more, tears in heaven.' We will be missing you Abigail Deveraux DiMera," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@katm20105</a> wrote, quoting a lyric from Eric Clapton's "Tears in Heaven" in a tweet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>And this might not be a drill. According to the latest reports, actress Marci Miller's departure from <a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a> could mark the end for the whole character. As head writer Ron Carlivati suggested in a new interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soap Opera Network</a>, the creative team is now shifting gears to explore the strange circumstances surrounding Abigail's murder and Chad's personal evolution in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ron Carlivati, the head writer on 'Days of Our Lives,' shared a few details about the shocking plot twist.</h2><p>As Ron told Soap Opera Network, the creative team behind <a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a> had a tough choice to face. On one hand, actress Marci Miller made it clear that she wasn't available to join the show full-time. On the other, they were keen to further explore Abigail and Chad's bond. In the end, they decided to kill off Abigail.</p><p>"For us and for the audience, it's always heartbreaking for a character to die because we love these characters, and they are part of our lives and part of our family," Ron said. "Even though it’s fictional, it hurts anytime we kill somebody. In this instance, it was mostly for a practical reason because Marci was not going to be available to us full-time on contract, and it made it challenging to tell the story [of] Chad and Abigail."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"So, we didn’t really have the option to have Abigail around, and then that always becomes a problem when one-half of a couple is not going to be available to you," he added. "What’s the solution at that point?"</p><p>As Ron acknowledged, plot twists like Abigail's death might not always feel final, especially in soap operas. But he added that they intend this creative decision to stick.</p><p>"There is always that possibility that death is not permanent, especially on a soap opera and especially in Salem, so you feel that maybe you’re not closing off the future of that character forever," he said. "That said, this is not going to be an instance of the car going off the cliff and you don’t see the person again. This is going to feel permanent, and we wrote it as permanent."</p><p>New episodes of Days of Our Lives air weekdays at 1 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aZkp60orXLZqOemaaaeqWt2KxkqJ5dpMKzecuirZ6r</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-how-much-the-top-nfl-draft-picks-will-make-with-their-contracts.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Much The Top NFL Draft Picks Will Make With Their Contracts</span></a>
